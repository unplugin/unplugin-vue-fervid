# unplugin-vue-fervid WIP

#### Use [fervid](https://github.com/phoenix-ru/fervid) to Transform Vue 3 SFC to JavaScript

Due to the need to consider `performance` and `compatibility` issues, `fervid` needs to refactor `node` api. Please look forward to it. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸš§ Working in Progress. 
  May be break changes in the future. The final implementation goal should be consistent with the vue compiler behavior
