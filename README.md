# unplugin-vue-fervid

#### Use [fervid Rust Compiler](https://github.com/phoenix-ru/fervid) to Transform Vue 3 SFC to JavaScript

Due to the need to consider `performance` and `compatibility` issues, `fervid` needs to refactor `node` api. Please look forward to it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> üöß Working in Progress.
> May be break changes in the future. The final implementation goal should be consistent with the vue compiler behavior

## Is it fast?
Yes, it is incredibly fast. In fact, below is a benchmark run for a [test component](crates/fervid/benches/fixtures/input.vue).

```
  @vue/compiler-sfc:
    954 ops/s, ¬±1.15%     | slowest, 98.42% slower

  @fervid/napi sync:
    6 464 ops/s, ¬±0.08%   | 89.29% slower

  @fervid/napi async (4 threads):
    11 624 ops/s, ¬±2.12%  | 80.73% slower

  @fervid/napi async CPUS (23 threads):
    60 329 ops/s, ¬±0.67%  | fastest
```

<!-- Micro-benchmarking has been done using Criterion, code for benchmarks can be found in `benches` directory. -->
Benchmarking in Node.js has been done using [`benny`](https://github.com/caderek/benny), slightly modified to take `libuv` threads into consideration.
